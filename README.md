# NewBies Hackathon UQCS 2025
# PVZ: Wrist in Peas

## ðŸŽ® What is this project?

**PVZ: Wrist in Peas** is a wrist-controlled motion game â€” a vertical scrolling shooter in the style of *space shooters*, but with a playful twist: it's themed after **Plants vs Zombies**.

Each round lasts about **2 minutes**, designed for light wrist activity â€” perfect as a quick break from typing or gaming marathons.

## ðŸ•¹ How to Play

You are **a humble zombie craving brains**, shambling up the lawn. Just like in the original *Plants vs Zombies*, plants form layered defenses.  
Your goal: **survive** the plant barrage and reach the end of the lawn to enjoy a fresh, delicious brain! ðŸ§ 

### Controls

- **Setup:**  
  Extend your right arm toward your PC screen, **back of the hand facing up**, so your webcam can capture your palm movements.
  
- **Move Right:**  
  Rotate your palm **clockwise** by 90Â°.

- **Move Left:**  
  Rotate your palm **counterclockwise** by a smaller angle.

- **Move Up / Down:**  
  Flex or extend your wrist.

- **(Optional) Special Skill:**  
  If stamina allows, we plan to add a custom gesture for skill activation  
  *(e.g., middle finger salute â€” though more likely a simple fist âœŠ)*.

## ðŸ’¡ Health Note
The motion control is designed for **short bursts of gentle wrist activity**, helping keep joints mobile and reducing stiffness from prolonged computer use.
